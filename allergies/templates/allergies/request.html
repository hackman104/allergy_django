<p>
    Here you may request that I add another restaurant's allergy information to this website. I ask that you please look for it
    first on the "search" page to ensure that I haven't already uploaded it. In addition, if you already know the link to the website,
    I ask that you send that in the provided box as well (though this is not required). Thank you for helping to build this
    project!
